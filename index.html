<body><p> My name is <b>Brandan</b>. I will correct you if it is any other way. I am 20 years old.</p>
<p>I'm on <a rel="me" href="https://chadthundercock.com/@brandan">Mastodon</a>. I also have autism, and ADHD. I think that should be all that you know about me, and anything else can be found out by being friends with me. <br>I've been part of many communities over the past 10 years of being online, and I don't plan on stopping.</p>
